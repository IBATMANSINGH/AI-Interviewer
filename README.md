# AI Interviewer

AI Interviewer is a React application that uses OpenRouter's AI capabilities to conduct and evaluate interviews on any topic. The application simulates a real interview experience by asking questions, evaluating answers, and providing a final assessment.

## Features

- Enter any interview topic and get AI-generated questions
- Answer questions in a conversational interface
- Receive immediate feedback and evaluation on each answer
- Complete a 10-question interview session
- Get a comprehensive evaluation with scores and recommendations

## Technologies Used

- React with Vite for frontend development
- Material UI for component library
- React Router for navigation
- OpenRouter API for AI-powered interview questions and evaluations
- Structured JSON output for consistent AI responses

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenRouter API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-interviewer.git
cd ai-interviewer
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your OpenRouter API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file and replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. Enter an interview topic (e.g., "JavaScript Development", "Data Science", "Product Management")
2. Click "Start Interview" to begin
3. Answer each question in the text area provided
4. Review the AI's evaluation of your answer
5. Continue until all 10 questions are completed
6. Review your final evaluation and score

### ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Process

This project was built using a "prompt-first" approach, where I leveraged an LLM as a coding co-pilot to translate a concept into a functional application.

*   **The Core Prompt:** I began by architecting the project with a high-level prompt to generate the foundational structure:
    > *"Create a Python application using Streamlit that simulates a job interview. The app should take a job role as input, generate relevant interview questions using an LLM, and then capture the user's answers. It should also provide feedback on the answers."*

*   **Iteration and Refinement:** The AI generated the basic UI. I then used follow-up prompts to build the core logic:
    *   "Write a function that uses Google's Gemini Pro API to generate 5 interview questions based on a given job role."
    *   "Implement a text-to-speech function using `gTTS` to have the AI ask the questions out loud."
    *   "Create a feedback loop where, after a user provides an answer, the Gemini API is called again with a prompt to evaluate the answer's quality."

*   **My Role as the Developer:** My primary role was not just to code, but to act as the architect. This involved designing the prompts (for both question generation and answer evaluation), critically evaluating and debugging the AI-generated code, integrating the different API calls into a cohesive conversational flow, and testing the final application for a realistic interview experience.
